# Amazon Vine Analysis

  -For this weeks project I am working with Jennifer on two fairly big projects. The project I will be focusiong on in this write up is all about the paid Amazon Vine program that lets customers write reviews of Manufacturers and Publishers to receive reviews written by customers. The big part to look at is accessing the nearly 50 data sets. Each set of data will contain it's own specific item. The items in the data sets we are going through aren't of a specific category and are spread out from clothing all the way to electronics.
